# Actions and WorkFlow (continuous integration)
This repository will create Continuous Integration (CI) builds using Github actions and workflow.

## Procedure
Follow below steps:
<br>
```
- create github repo
- using cmd clone the repo to your local pc
- 
- using visual studio create below .net project at a different folder than where your github project has been cloned. 
 create the .net project using: file new > asp.net core web api (.net 5)
 do not place sln file with project. After creating the project the structure of the project folder should contain 3 files: .vs, webapplicaion1 and sln file. 
- copy the generated code .net web api project code into the folder of the newly cloned repository
<br>
- above procedure may seem ackward, however it helps prevent issues that would have gone wrong if we had made the asp.net core web api project inside the cloned directory
<br>
- open the folder with both the .net code and github cloned repo using visual studio code
- at .vs to gitignore file
